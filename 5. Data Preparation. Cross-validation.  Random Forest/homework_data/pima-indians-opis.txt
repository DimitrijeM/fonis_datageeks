It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Missing values are believed to be encoded with zero values. The variable names are as follows:

Number of times pregnant.
Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).

2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
Diabetes pedigree function.
